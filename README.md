-----

In 2022, Wordpress is still really good for a lot of sites. The new Gutenberg full-site editor is üî• good. I hope this project helps you, just like it helps me host my sites.

* üòç Easy to configure
* üí∞ Budget-friendly setup. Stuff as many sites as you can on your $5 server.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è Automated daily backups + weekly backups by email.
* üí™ Firewall protection with `ufw`
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Pre-installs [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) for speed optimization
* üß™ Tested on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
* ‚õë Wordpress update email alerts *(üë®‚Äçüíª Coming soon)*
* üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Server monitoring with email alerts *(üë®‚Äçüíª Coming soon)*

> You still need to enable disk backups with your cloud provider.

## Install

Install python3 and clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/HashNuke/wordpress-deploy.git wordpress-deploy
cd wordpress-deploy

# Install pipenv
pip3 install pipenv

# Install python dependencies
pipenv install

# Start a python virtual environment
pipenv shell
```

## Deploy a site

> Please follow the same order of instructions to avoid issues.

### [Step-1] Create a server with Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) on your cloud provider

Ensure to choose SSH key as the authentication method and add the SSH key to your local SSH key agent.

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykey
```

### [Step-2] Add DNS records

You need DNS records for the following:

#### Domain/subdomain for email notifications

* The backup emails, server alerts, etc, are sent out from your own server.
* For this to work, please point an A-record for any subdomain to the server's IP (example: `anything.example.com`)
* Make note of this domain/subdomain.

#### Domain/subdomain for the new website

* If your website will be served at `example.com`, then
  * Add an A-record pointing to `example.com` pointing to the server's IP
  * Add a CNAME record for `www.example.com` pointing to example.com
* If your website will be served at `blog.example.com`, then
  * Add an A record for `blog.example.com` pointing to the server's IP

### [Step-3] Add a server to the `hosts` file

Create a host file with the name of the server and IP address like below.

I've named my server as `personal`, but you can name it whatever.

```play
[personal]
1.2.3.4
```

### [Step-4] Create a config file in the `sites` dir

* Copy the sample configuration to create a config for your site.
* Please read the configuration file and set the values appropriately.

```
cp sites/sample.yml sites/mysite.yml
```

Refer to the [configuration section](#configuration) below for details about options.

### [Step-5] Deploy

```
ansible-playbook setup.yml --extra-vars @sites/mysite.yml
```

### [Step-6] Check the post-install notification email (DO NOT SKIP)

* You will receive an email from deployer@something about your site being setup successfully. Check your spam if you did not receive it.
* Please add this to your contacts so that you do not miss this email.

This email is coming from the server you just setup. You will get a backup of your site every 7 days.

## FAQs

#### What email notifications are sent?

For now, the email notifications are only for backups.

[üë®‚ÄçüíªComing soon] The recipient configured in `notify_email` will be notified when the following scenarios occur:
* When the server disk space is 80% filled
* When the server memory is at 80% utilization
* When nginx or fastcgi is down
* When there is a new wordpress version

#### How to restore backups?

The backups emailed to you are SQL backups.
* Lookup on how to restore a MySQL/MariaDB database.
* The files in `wp-content/uploads` folder are not part of the backups. These would most likely be large to be sent over email. Please ensure to enable disk backups on your cloud provider.

As much as I would love to improve backups and backup restoration, I am also limited by time.

#### Why not use Kubernetes, Docker, etc?

This project is designed to be budget-friendly. I wanted to setup something small for my family and my hobby projects.

#### How to update Wordpress version?

[Coming soon üë®‚Äçüíª] The plan is to notify you via email about new wordpress versions for any sites that are outdated.
